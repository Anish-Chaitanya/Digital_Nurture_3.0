Logger Class:

Private Static Instance: Ensures only one instance of Logger is created.
Private Constructor: Prevents creation of instances outside the class.
Synchronized Method: Ensures thread safety when multiple threads access the getInstance method.
Log Method: A sample method to demonstrate logging functionality.
Main Class:

Retrieves two references to the Logger instance.
Logs messages using both references.
Prints whether the two references are the same instance, verifying the Singleton pattern.
Running the Code
Create the Project:

In your IDE, create a new Java project named SingletonPatternExample.
Add two classes: Logger and Main.
Add the Code:

Copy the provided Logger.java code into the Logger class file.
Copy the provided Main.java code into the Main class file.
Run the Main Class:

Execute Main class to see the output and verify the Singleton behavior.
The expected output should confirm that both logger1 and logger2 point to the same instance of the Logger class, and the log messages should be printed to the console.
