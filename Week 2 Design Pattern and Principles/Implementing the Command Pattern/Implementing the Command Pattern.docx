Explanation of the Code Structure
Command Interface (Command):

Defines the execute() method that all concrete commands must implement.
Concrete Commands (LightOnCommand, LightOffCommand):

Implement the Command interface.
Each command class encapsulates a request to perform a specific action (turnOn or turnOff) on the Light receiver.
Invoker Class (RemoteControl):

Holds a reference to a Command object.
Provides a method setCommand() to set the command and pressButton() to execute the command.
Receiver Class (Light):

Contains the methods turnOn() and turnOff() to perform the actual operations.
Test Class (CommandPatternTest):

Demonstrates how to use RemoteControl to issue commands (LightOnCommand and LightOffCommand) to the Light receiver.
