Why Data Structures and Algorithms are Essential:

Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial in handling large inventories because they directly impact the performance of the inventory management system. With large volumes of data, operations like searching for a product, updating product details, and removing products need to be executed quickly to ensure smooth and effective inventory management. Poorly chosen data structures can lead to slow performance and scalability issues.

Data Structures provide a way to organize and store data efficiently so that it can be accessed and modified quickly.
Algorithms define the methods used to perform operations on these data structures, such as searching, inserting, and deleting.
Types of Data Structures Suitable for This Problem:

ArrayList (or List in general):

Suitable for scenarios where you need indexed access and your primary operations are iterating over the list or adding/removing items at the end.
Operations like search, add, and delete may be inefficient if not managed properly because searching requires linear time in the worst case.
HashMap (or Dictionary in general):

Ideal for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.
Uses a hash table to map keys (e.g., productId) to values (e.g., Product objects), providing average time complexity of O(1) for these operations.
Useful when the operations involve frequent lookups by a unique identifier (such as productId).
TreeMap (or Balanced Binary Search Tree):

Useful for ordered data, supporting efficient operations such as sorted traversals.
Provides O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.



Time Complexity Analysis:

Add Operation (addProduct): O(1) on average. Insertion into a HashMap is done in constant time.
Update Operation (updateProduct): O(1) on average. Updating an existing entry in a HashMap is done in constant time.
Delete Operation (deleteProduct): O(1) on average. Removal from a HashMap is done in constant time.
Retrieve Operation (getProduct): O(1) on average. Accessing an element by key in a HashMap is done in constant time.

Optimization Discussion:

HashMap Performance: In practice, HashMap operations can degrade to O(n) in the worst case due to collisions. Using a load factor and choosing an appropriate initial capacity can help mitigate this risk.
Memory Usage: HashMap uses extra space for hashing and maintaining the internal structure. For very large inventories, this overhead might be significant.
Concurrency: If the inventory management system needs to handle concurrent access (e.g., multiple users updating the inventory simultaneously), consider using ConcurrentHashMap or implementing synchronization mechanisms.
