Sorting Algorithms Overview:

Bubble Sort:

Description: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) (when the list is already sorted, with an optimized version that stops early)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sort)
Insertion Sort:

Description: Builds the final sorted list one item at a time by comparing each new item with the already sorted portion of the list and inserting it into the correct position.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) (when the list is already sorted)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sort)
Quick Sort:

Description: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2) (when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot)
Space Complexity: O(log n) (for the recursive stack)
Merge Sort:

Description: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n) (for the temporary arrays used during merging)
Time Complexity Comparison:

Bubble Sort:

Best Case: O(n) (optimized version)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Characteristics: Simple but inefficient for large datasets.
Quick Sort:

Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Characteristics: Generally efficient with good average-case performance, but requires careful choice of pivot to avoid worst-case behavior.
Why Quick Sort is Preferred:

Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort due to its better average-case time complexity of O(n log n) compared to Bubble Sort’s O(n^2). Quick Sort’s divide-and-conquer approach provides more efficient sorting for large datasets, making it a more scalable solution. Bubble Sort, while simpler, becomes impractical for larger arrays due to its quadratic time complexity.
